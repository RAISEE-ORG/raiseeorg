The advent of the Internet has brought many conveniences to mankind.  Unfortunately, it has also facilitated much crime and scams. Last year, the United States Department of State released a Declaration For the Future of America.  https://www.state.gov/declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet
A goal of this declaration is to build trust in the digital ecosystem, by fighting cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime, and to protect vulnerable consumers (such as the Elderly) from online scams.  We strongly believe in these goals.  As such, we fight cybercrime and protect the elderly by training them and making them aware of the red flags of scams.  We provide information on best practices for defending yourself from  becoming a victim.  We provide CONSULTATION and COMPUTER SERVICES to both defend and repair from scams.  
Your computer is SACRED.
